# project-Gans
Some Description!
Gans is a start-up e-scooter sharing system. It aspires to start to operate in the most populous cities all around the world. In each city, the company will have hundreds of e-scooters parked on the streets and allow users to rent them by the minute. Facing a lot of notorious and more established competitors now expanding throughout other European countries, the focus of most e-scooter companies is sustainable mobility. However, Gans has seen that its operational success depends on something more mundane: having its scooters parked where users need them. This is where I come in: My task will be to collect data from external sources that can potentially help Gans predict e-scooter movement. Since data is needed every day, in real-time, and accessible by everyone in the company, the challenge is going to be to assemble and automate a data pipeline in the cloud.
